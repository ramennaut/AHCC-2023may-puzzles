    "## Question 2: Who's the fastest runner? (1 mark)\n",
    "\n",
    "Run run run away! A group of friends wanted to know who is the fastest amongst them, and decided to hold a running race.\n",
    "\n",
    "It wasn't fun just running, so they decided to go for a marathon. These guys are good, but must rest occasionally to recover their energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Did I mention that these people are weird? They can only be running (always at the top speed), or resting (not moving at all), and can only spend **interger amounts of time** in either state.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Example case:\n",
    "\n",
    "John can run 10m/s for 6 seconds, but them must rest for 20 seconds. James can run 8m/s for 8 seconfs, but then must rest for 25 seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "After one second (T=1), John has gone 10m, while James has gone 8m. After 6 seconds (T=6), John has gone 60m, while James has gone 48m. On the 7th second, John begins resting (staying at 60m), while James continues on for a total distance of 64m. On the 9th second, both runners are resting. They continue to rest until the 27th second when John runs for another 6 seconds. On the 34th second, James runs for another 8 seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the 100th second, John is resting after running 240m while James has travelled 200m. In this case, John would have won if the race ended at 100 seconds.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the descriptions of this group of friends:\n",
    "1. John can run 10m/s for 6 seconds, but then must rest for 20 seconds.\n",
    "2. James can run 8m/s for 8 seconds, but then must rest for 25 seconds.\n",
    "3. Jenna can run 12m/s for 5 seconds, but then must rest for 16 seconds.\n",
    "4. Josh can run 7m/s for 7 seconds, but then must rest for 23 seconds.\n",
    "5. Jacob can run 9m/s for 4 seconds, but then must rest for 32 seconds.\n",
    "6. Jerry can run 5m/s for 9 seconds, but then must rest for 18 seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "After 1234 seconds, what is the distance of the winning runner?"
